      <p>
        I started out as a hobbyiest programmer after university and
        my national youth service program and went on practising and 
        building <a href="/work" class="text-secondary app-title">projects</a>.
        After a year into practising and building <a href="/work" class="text-secondary app-title">projects</a>,
        my sister approached me and asked me to help her out with
        manually sorting and printing vouchers for her business,
        after awhile the job got so cumbersome as the customer and
        demand increases. Hence, the need to automate the process.
        I gladly took the challenge and came up with the solution
        that birthed the <a href="#" class="text-secondary app-title">Epin-Sorter</a>;
        a Chrome-extension browser app for the sorting and printing of the vouchers hosted 
        on chrome web store for private use by her company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on projects and serviced clients which have helped me honed my skill as a software developer but as a keen
        engineer, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to deliver and offer my best on progressive jobs and projects;
        I have developed a good track record with web development for the last two years using web technologies such as HTMl,
        CSS, Jquery and JavaScript both on the frontend and backend, I have also worked with databases such as NEDB for
        in-memory data storage and management, MongoDb and Mongoose for larger datasets at the backend, Graphql, Axios and
        browser inbuilt fetch API.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a lot to offer as an engineer who has been working hard at his craft;
        I have a quick grasp of new concepts and technology which is why I am working
        hard to build a successful career as a software engineer and hopefully be
        reckoned with as an expert in my field.
